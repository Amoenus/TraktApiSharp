    "comment": "I think this was a piss poor continuation of the \"Original\" star wars..  They ripped off the same exact plot, the same exact scenes, the same exact everything.   Oh we have CGI now so lets just use it everywhere for everything.. This episode used ZERO creativity and left me with an absolute horrible taste in my mouth for both Disney and a man i thought highly of  J. J. Abrams.   For hard core star wars fans like myself to hype this and end with such a disgrace and disrespect to something George Lucas made history with ???   Disgusted with how this was just a money grabbing endeavour.. that is by far the worst Star Wars Episode ever...   It will NEVER sit on the same shelf with the rest of the great Star Wars Box Set...   pffffffffft   glad i didn't pay a dime and downloaded this piece of shit rendition  and really? Carrie Fisher had a movie coming up and she didn't really care what she looked like?  And how do you just off Han Solo like that...  sorry folks... absolutely disgusted with this.",

    "comment": "I last saw the first-made three films about ten years ago, and still enjoyed them. This film is far superior to the three films that were last made, but is still an uncomfortable ball of prejudice and xenophobia. The blu-ray actually subtitles some dialogue as spoken by \"ALIEN\". Well...who's an alien in all this, then? Isn't that a note on the bars that definitely should not be in-place? Drab.\r\n\r\nIn total, the film bored me. Could be that Star Wars isn't in me any more, or that I'm too alienated by it.",

    "comment": "I'm not a star wars fan and I'll never be. The whole movie just feels like it popped out of the eighties. The old formula, good vs evil, doesn't work anymore. Everything was too shallow, there isn't no proper character development, they're just running and fighting constantly. Basically, for me, it was a very silly movie full of hype and sexism. Disappointed but not surprised.",

Ford back to the source, the rest of the casting is quite good except for Kylo Ren, as soon as he removes his mask he look so stupid. A caricature of the villain. In the end a nice entertainment nothing more. But what could you expect from Disney...",
