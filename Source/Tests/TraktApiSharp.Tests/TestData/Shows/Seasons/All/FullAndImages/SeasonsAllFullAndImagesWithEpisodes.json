        "overview": "“George R.R. Martin meets Chris Martin – what could go wrong?” That’s Emilia Clarke in the epic, 12-minute video for Coldplay’s totally fake Game of Thrones musical, right before she rips into a song called “Rastafarian Targaryen.” Here’s a sample lyric: “Call me Daenerys Targaryen when you want to reach me, and if you feel the love then you can call me Khalessi.”\n\nThe sketch, part of Red Nose Day, includes cast members Kit Harington, Peter Dinklage, John Bradley, Rose Leslie, Charlotte Pope, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Alfie Allen and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who performs a piano ballad called “Closer to Home” to a photo of Lena Headey as Cersei. (“Are you thinking about Joffrey? Such a spirited lad. I was his uncle, I was also his dad.”)",

    "overview": "Il Re dei Sette Regni di Westeros, Robert Baratheon, si reca a Grande Inverno, per chiedere al suo amico Ned Stark di accettare la carica di Primo Cavaliere. Inoltre il Re propone un matrimonio tra suo figlio Joffrey, erede al trono di spade e la figlia di Ned, Sansa. Da questo incontro prende il via una serie di eventi che porterà Ned, Sansa e Arya ad Approdo del Re, mentre il resto della famiglia Stark rimane a Grande Inverno per controllare il territorio. I delicati equilibri politici si infrangono quando qualcuno cerca di far tacere definitivamente il piccolo Bran Stark, colpevole di aver scoperto un terribile segreto. Lady Catelyn Stark riceve conferma dei suoi sospetti e accusa i Lannister del misfatto, evento scatenante che darà il via a una serie di conflitti. Intanto al di là del Mare Stretto, Viserys Targaryen, figlio del Re Folle Aerys II, deposto da Robert Baratheon, dà sua sorella Daenerys in sposa a Khal Drogo, un potente condottiero che gli promette un esercito per riappropriarsi del trono dei Sette Regni.",
